# machine_learning_ICL
This project is aim to compare the traditional machine learning algorithms and the In-context learning(ICL)
The project is divided into two parts:
1. Explore what kind of tasks/datasets is ICL better/worse than classical supervised learning methods.
2. Explore how to improve the performance of ICL(i.e change the size/prompt/tempreture of the LLM).

ml_vs_icl.py: Compare machine learning algorithms with ICL algorithm
prompt_lenght: Compare different sizes of prompt
llm_size: Experiment with different llm
